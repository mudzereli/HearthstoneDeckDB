###Goals of Site:
- Assist in competitive deckbuilding without "Netdecking" card-for-card.
- Statistical information about decks such as Archetype %, Class %, Events, etc.
- Keep ALL deck lists intact and available.
- Easy exporting to Hearthstone Deck Tracker.

###To Do:
- speed up dropdowns for card selections
- Easier copy to clipboard for import to HDT
    + convert decks to model above and create a "copy to clipboard" button which reads the counts of the appropriate category to the clipboard
- Card Counts on Deck Stats Panels (i.e. 22 Auto Include Cards)
    + converting decks to model above will be able to count these by appropriate category
- Show card pics / class colors / etc
    + not sure how to do this properly without taking up a lot of zamimg resources
- more statistics at top of deck filters:
    + Deck Filters (520 decks <from period x to y over z events and t archetypes and p players)
- add release / nerf / etc game changing dates to calendar pickers
