# Hearthstone Deck DB

###Goals of Site:
- Assist in competitive deckbuilding without "Netdecking" card-for-card.
- Statistical information about decks such as Archetype %, Class %, Events, etc.
- Keep ALL deck lists intact and available.
- Easy exporting to Hearthstone Deck Tracker.

###To Do:
- speed up dropdowns for card selections ($scope.LookupCard())

###Done:
- more statistics at top of deck filter panel
- easier copy to clipboard for import to hdt
- card counts on deck stats panels (i.e. 22 auto include cards)

###Later:
- add game-changing dates to datepicker (patches/set releases/etc)
- card pics / class colors
