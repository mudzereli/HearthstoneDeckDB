[Visit the Site!](https://mudzereli.github.io/HearthstoneDeckDB/#/)

###Goals of Site:
- Assist in competitive deckbuilding without "Netdecking" card-for-card.
- Statistical information about decks such as Archetype %, Class %, Events, etc.
- Keep ALL deck lists intact and available.
- Easy exporting to Hearthstone Deck Tracker.

###Todo:
- more optimizations and ui tweaks

###Done:
-  updates for mobile performance
- add "copy deck to clipboard" button to dashboard deck list
- cut off deck history older than 2 patches ago (yogg nerf). this should help performance a lot.
- card info on mouseover
- speed up site
- more statistics at top of deck filter panel
- easier copy to clipboard for import to hdt
- card counts on deck stats panels (i.e. 22 auto include cards)

###Later:
- add game-changing dates to datepicker (patches/set releases/etc)
