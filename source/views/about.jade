    h3 Why did I make this when there are already so many Angular boilerplates?

    | I love AngularJS but none of the existing boilerplates had everything I wanted. None of them worked in IE8
    | and I couldn&apos;t find any that used LESS. Also, call me crazy but I prefer using CDN to manage my JS files
    | in my project so I don&apos;t have to manually deal with the physical files, so this boilerplate includes
    | everything except Bootstrap as a CDN link. The reason Bootstrap is not linked in through CDN is because
    | Respond JS (IE Compatability) requires a local copy of the CSS which makes the media queries (Bootstrap).
    | Also, I have yet to see another boilerplate which has a built in browser-saving theme selector (which I think is awesome).
